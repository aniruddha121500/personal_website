I am Aniruddha Mukherjee. Currenlty, I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Moreover, I am also pursuing a minor in Business for non-Business, a minor in Economics with a specialization in Econometrics, and a certificate in Data Science.

Other than my academic intrests, I like to travel. I have visited to many countries in Europe and many places within the United States. Some of my most memorable travelling expiriences include Switzerland and England. I enjoyed visiting Switzerland for its iconic scenery like the Matterhorn Mountain and the Rhine Falls. I enjoyed visiting England for its green rolling meadows and the city of London. My travelogues are on my Wordpress site (link below).

Apart from travelling and education, I am very much interested in soccer. I reguarly watch the British Premier league and the Fifa world cup. In highschool and college, I developed a model to predict the winner for games played in the Fifa World cup. The model and results are on my Wordpress site (link below).
